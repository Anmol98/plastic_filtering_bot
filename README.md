# Plastic Filtering Bot
INTRODUCTION

An estimated 12.7 million tonnes of plastic – everything from plastic bottles and bags to microbeads – end up in our oceans each year. Our oceans are slowly turning into a plastic soup and the effects on ocean life are chilling. Big pieces of plastic are choking and entangling turtles and seabirds and tiny pieces are clogging the stomachs of creatures who mistake it for food, from tiny zooplankton to whales. Plastic is now entering every level of the ocean food chain and even ending up in the seafood on our plates. Once in the ocean, plastic decomposes very slowly, breaking down into tiny pieces known as micro plastics that can be incredibly damaging to sea life.
This project aims to create a small scale implementation of a bot that filters plastic out from water.

CURRENT STUDY

We plan to use OpenCV Python on a Raspberry Pi to build an underwater Image Processing software that detects Plastic from other components in the water. A bot will be used to navigate in the water, that contains the brain of the project and an attached camera. After locating areas of high concentration of plastic, we will use the bot and a net controlled by a servo motor (interfaced with the RPi) to filter the plastic out. Another objective of this project includes performing IP online, i.e., while swimming, rather than as an offline process. 
Further, after successful implementation of the above, we hope to develop the IP algorithm to further distinguish small microplastics from bigger pieces.
